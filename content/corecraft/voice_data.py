"""Aggregates the per-kind voice banks and holds the shared sentence patterns.

A pattern is (items needed, facts needed, template). Facts: city, name, hours, offer, phone. The writer keeps only the patterns
whose needs are met, so a page about a business that gave no hours simply never uses an "open until" sentence.
