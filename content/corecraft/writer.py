"""Writes the text of a page from facts, a kind (voice) and a profile (vocabulary). English path; Hindi data lives in voice_hi.py.

Every sentence is built from the person's own words (name, city, services, offers, hours) plus the voice of the kind of business:
a restaurant serves and cooks, a clinic examines and treats, a gym trains, a shop stocks. Nothing is invented: a fact that
was not given leaves out the sentence that would have used it.
