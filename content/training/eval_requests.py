"""How well does the content AI understand what people type? Uses the training PDF's own requests: 99 niches x 6 ways of asking (594) and the 20 business types x 3 (60).
Run: python3 training/eval_requests.py [-v]
1. all requests, full keyword lists
2. hold-out: for every niche, the exact words used in its own requests are taken OUT of its keywords, label and services before it is asked
   (so "termite treatment" must be understood from the other words: cockroach, pest, fumigation ...)."""
