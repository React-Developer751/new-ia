"""Learn the fillers for sentence frames from the real-site corpus, per niche:
 - plural nouns (checked to really behave as nouns), scored by how characteristic they are of the niche
 - co-occurrence: which nouns appear together with which prompt words (so "jewellery" pulls in rings, not sweaters)
Frames (grammar) live in corecraft/template_model.py; this script learns what goes in the slots."""
